This page is based on the reading list from [Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/my-reading-list/). I think it's a splendid format to share books that I recommend.

This is a collection of software engineering and engineering management books that I have read and would recommend to others.

## Currently Reading

These are books I have either read, or ones I'm reading.

The Coding Career Handbook: guides, principles, strategies and tactics from code newbie to senior developer. Impressions so far: I'm impressed. Lots of fresh ideas, and food for thought.
The Standout Developer: a complete guide for developers on job hunting, acing the interview and landing the job. Impressions so far: I like the authentic voice from Randall. I'd recommend this book for people starting out in software, or with a few years' experience.
14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers: a short and sweet book, with good inspiration from prolific software engineers (Kindle version, ePub version)
Software Engineering at Google. Impressions so far: the second part is interesting in getting a proper look into Google software engineering practices.
But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone. Impressions so far: I've picked this up, reading with a friend. Most of it is a refresher on how computers work. I am interested in how simple the explanations are for something complex. So far, it's an okay book.

## Engineering Books

These are books I learned a lot from, as a software engineer.

★★★★★

* [Grokking Algorithms](https://amzn.to/3pvir0o). A great intro, or a refresher for all the algorithms that you'd likely need to use at a tech company.

* [Clean Code](https://amzn.to/3f4tfO8)- A reference book of coding best practices/patterns for a healthy codebase with some case studies. I read this book after having about five years' professional coding experience. It changed how I approached code readability, testing, and maintenance.

* [Domain Driven Design](https://amzn.to/32NQx63) - Great book to learn all the basics from DDD. From Ubiquitous language to bounded context, you can really learn a lot in this book.

★★★★☆

* [Refactoring](https://amzn.to/3lDbNmG) - A book by Martin Fowler. It comes with great patterns on how to refactor your code in a smart and iterative way. It's a must read for every engineer.

* [Clean Architecture](https://amzn.to/3f4tfO8)- From the same writer of Clean Code, this books cover the architecture gotchas that we need to be careful. It also gives us many tips on how to build an effective architecture. 

* [Site Reliability Engineering](https://amzn.to/3kzDD1R): How Google Runs Production Systems - Hardcover & (free) online book - a good overview of SRE at Google. For those who worked at places with oncall, much of the first part of the book will likely be very familiar. Keep in mind that your mileage might vary: what works at Google scale, might not be the ideal fit for your use case.

★★★☆☆

Software Architecture Patterns by Mark Richards - a lightweight introduction to common design patterns that can be read in one sitting. Covers layered, event-driven, microkernel, microservices and space-based architecture.

## (Engineering) Management Books

These are books that helped me level up, being a tech lead and engineering manager.

★★★★★

* [The Manager's Path](https://amzn.to/3f0FnzM) - a concise guide for managers, from tech lead, through line managers, managers of managers, all the way to CTO.

* [The Phoenix Project](https://amzn.to/3kyPsVU) - a novel inspired by the Goal, this time playing inside an enterprise in 2010.

* [An Elegant Puzzle](https://amzn.to/3kHB3Hb) - a long overdue read for engineering leads. The most hands-on read on engineering management I've picked up. Apart from the book, the Recommended Papers section in the appendix list excellent engineering reads. See my in-detail review and book notes.

## Newsletters
Curated newsletters are my preferred way to stay up to speed with what's new and relevant on software engineering. I've tried out many newsletters and here are my favorite ones, which I keep reading through every week. (Note: I also send a newsletter on engineering, tech leadership and distributed systems once a month).

### Tech Leadership
Software Lead Weekly by Oren Ellenbogen, VP of engineering at Forter. Five articles per week on technology and leadership. 23,500+ readers.
* [Level Up](http://levelup.patkua.com/) from [Pat Kua](https://twitter.com/patkua), Chief Scientist at N26. ANother brilliant persona that I had the privilege to work with. In his newsletter you can find, 15-20 interesting links on leadership, tech, organizations, and processes.
* [The Weekly Hagakure](https://hagakure.substack.com/) by [Paulo André](https://twitter.com/prla), previously director of engineering at Hello Fresh which I had the privilege to work with. A weekly newsletter with 3 articles, 2 videos, and 1 book recommendation for technical leaders.

### Software Engineering
 * [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) - interesting links shared every week about what's going on in the engineering industry.

## Podcasts

I frequently listen to the below podcasts.

### Tech Leadership
* [The critical channel](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-critical-channel-criticalchannelio-UIiaVfJRxrs/) - podcast that I co-host. It's about leadership, culture and much more.
