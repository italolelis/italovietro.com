## Engineering for Scale, Leading for Impact

I'm currently **Head of Engineering at [Parloa](https://parloa.com)**, architecting the core services behind Europe's leading agentic-AI customer service platform. We're turning complex real-time conversations into fast, reliable experiences for millions of users daily.

But the journey that brought me here started in **Brazil**, where I spent seven formative years going from junior developer to technical lead. Those years taught me that the best systems and teams thrive when knowledge travels faster than code—a principle that has guided every role since.

### Where I've Made Impact

At **[Babbel](https://babbel.com)** as VP of Platform, I rebuilt a global learning engine that quietly serves language lessons across the globe. The challenge wasn't just technical—it was about creating systems that feel invisible when they work perfectly.

Leading engineering at **[Urban Sports Club](https://urbansportsclub.com)**, I established a TechHub in Spain from scratch, tripling our delivery cadence. The secret wasn't working harder—it was replacing ad-hoc heroics with transparent goals and steady, compounding gains.

As **CTO at [Lykon](https://lykon.com)**, I bootstrapped a 40+ microservice health-tech stack while building a culture of open RFCs and blameless post-mortems. Technology choices matter, but culture compounds.

At **[N26](https://n26.com)**, I led 40 engineers across core banking systems, shifting from centralized sign-offs to squad ownership. "You build it, you run it, you own it" became our everyday culture, not just a slogan.

My time at **[HelloFresh](https://hellofresh.com)** took me from Senior Engineer to Head of Engineering, where together with an incredible team we shepherded the leap from monolithic PHP to cloud-native Go services—scaling to 100+ engineers while keeping Fridays as "friday-beers" days, not crunch sessions.

## What Drives Me

I believe the best engineering leaders build environments where **technical excellence and business impact aren't trade-offs**—they're the same thing.

I'm passionate about Go, Kubernetes, platform engineering, and creating cultures where teams ship with confidence. Whether it's designing distributed systems or mentoring future leaders, I focus on solutions that scale both technically and humanly.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting systems, you'll find me tinkering with my homelab, automating everything at home, brewing coffee with precision, strategizing over D&D campaigns, or—most importantly—being a dedicated dad and husband.

I'm deep into home automation and self-hosting—building my own infrastructure at home is where I experiment and learn. Aviation and flight tech still fascinate me, but these days it's more about Kubernetes clusters running in my basement.
