Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Italo Vietro, currently embracing life in Berlin, Germany.

> At the moment, I'm steering the ship as VP of Platform at [Babbel](https://babbel.com). Itâ€™s here that I blend my love for innovation with practical technology solutions. My days are filled with leading our platform product team, sparking innovation, and ensuring everything scales smoothly.

Before this adventure at Babbel, I had the amazing opportunity to shape the future as VP of Engineering at [Urban Sports Club](https://urbansportsclub.com). It was a wild ride overseeing a vibrant team of over 100 brilliant minds, setting up an efficient TechHub in Spain, and slashing operational costs by 20%â€”all in a day's work! The role had me rolling up my sleeves to set up key engineering KPIs and revamp our hiring strategy. Transforming an ambitious company into a powerhouse was no small feat, but hey, that's what I thrive on!

Taking a stroll down memory lane, I was the CTO at [Lykon](https://lykon.de/), where I got to build a team from the ground up. We crafted a platform with over 40 microservicesâ€”a testament to our hard work and dedication to innovation. This role taught me the importance of transparent technical decision-making and resilient engineering practices.

Before Lykon, at [N26](https://n26.com/), I captained a talented crew of 40 engineers, focusing on the bedrock of our core banking services. Empowering teams to make sound decisions and streamline operations was the goal, and we nailed it!

My German saga began at [HelloFresh](https://hellofresh.com/), where I climbed from Senior Software Engineer to Head of Engineering. Transitioning to a microservices architecture, moving away from PHP to [Go](https://go.dev/), and scaling the team were monumental tasks, but together, we made it happen.

But letâ€™s rewind even further to my roots in Brazil, where my tech journey kicked off. Over seven incredible years, I evolved from a Junior Engineer cutting my teeth on code to leading major software projects.

When I'm not knee-deep in code, I'm a coffee aficionado, aviation enthusiast, and tabletop strategist with Dungeons & Dragons. Above all, I'm a dedicated dad and husband, always striving to balance a fulfilling family life with a bustling tech career.

Throughout my journey, I've teamed up with some of the brightest minds to tackle fascinating challenges. This space is where I share those stories and lessons, from engineering insights to leadership strategies. Curious about what I read or want to hear more about my public talks?
