Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Italo Vietro. Iâ€™m a Brazilian living in Berlin, Germany. Currently working as CTO [@Lykon](https://lykon.de/).

I've spent 3,5 years working at [@HelloFresh](https://hellofresh.com/), in Berlin. I worked from developing software at a high scale, to growing a team of 13 people to a 300 people organization.
We went through hyper-growth, and had to learn on the go how to build an effective organization. I believe we were pretty successful, and I had extremely good people next to me, from which I learned a lot.

Eventually, I moved on to [@N26](https://n26.com/), to explore new horizons. That was an amazing experience. I met lots of brilliant people, went though hyper-growth once again, but now in a different scale -- global.
We had to learn, in very little time, how to build teams across distributed sites and still ensure we could foster an engineering culture were people could feel safe and productive.

Finally, I moved on to a new challenge. Now, in a very different setup. I wanted to try to build an organization from scratch. So, I took the role of CTO at [@Lykon](https://lykon.de/). Here I have the opportunity to guide a tech department in all fronts. With the experience I got from prior challenges, I can share and help people to grow in their careers, build an awesome product and technology in the coming years. It is a hard road, I have to say, but it's one that I'm enjoying a lot.

Throughout my career I had the opportunity to work with inspiring people, on many different challenging projects, solving interesting problems. On this blog, I'm sharing my learnings for building and shipping successful products/projects, from an engineer and lead perspective. You can also read about [some of the books that I read and would recommend](my-reading-list) and check out some of the [public talks I have given](talks).
