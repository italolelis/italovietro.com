Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Italo Vietro, based in Berlin, Germany.

Currently working as VP of Platform Engineering [@urbansportsclub](https://urbansportsclub.com). Previously, I was heading the technology department as CTO [@Lykon](https://lykon.de/), where I built a great engineering team to innovate in the HealthTech industry.

I've spent 3,5 years working at [@HelloFresh](https://hellofresh.com/) in Berlin. I worked from developing software at a large scale to growing a team of 13 people to a 300 people organization.
We went through hyper-growth and had to learn on the go how to build an effective organization. I believe we were pretty successful, and I had extremely good people next to me from which I learned a lot.

Eventually, I moved on to [@N26](https://n26.com/) to explore new horizons. That was a fantastic experience, and I met many brilliant people and went through hyper-growth once again, but now on a different scale -- global.
In very little time, we had to learn how to build teams across distributed sites and still ensure we could foster an engineering culture where people could feel safe and productive.

Finally, I moved on to a new challenge. Now, in a very different setup. I wanted to try to build an organization from scratch. So, I took the role of CTO at [@Lykon](https://lykon.de/). Here I have the opportunity to guide a tech department on all fronts. With the experience I got from past challenges, I can share and help people to grow in their careers and build incredible products and technology in the coming years. I have to say it is a hard road, but it's one that I'm enjoying.

Throughout my career, I worked with inspiring people on many different challenging projects, solving interesting problems. This blog shares my learnings for building and shipping successful products/projects from an engineer and leadership perspective. You can also read about [some of the books that I read and would recommend](my-reading-list) and check out some of the [public talks I have given](talks).
