Hello üëã I'm Italo Vietro, based in Berlin, Germany.

> I'm currently working as VP of Platform Engineering @urbansportsclub. Previously, I was heading the technology department as CTO @Lykon. I also worked @N26 and @HelloFresh, mainly growing outstanding teams, fostering a good engineering culture, and doing things in [Go](https://go.dev/). I enjoy working with distributed systems and solving complex problems.

I've spent 3,5 years working at [@HelloFresh](https://hellofresh.com/) in Berlin. I worked from developing software at a large scale to growing a team of 13 people to a 300 people organization.
We went through hyper-growth and had to learn on the go how to build an effective organization. We were pretty successful, and I had extremely good people next to me, from which I learned a lot.

Eventually, I moved on to [@N26](https://n26.com/) to explore new horizons. That was a fantastic experience, and I met many brilliant people and went through hyper-growth once again, but now on a different scale -- global.
In very little time, we had to learn how to build teams across distributed sites and still ensure we could foster an engineering culture where people could feel safe and productive.

I then moved on to a new challenge. Now, in a very different setup. I wanted to build an organization from scratch. So, I took the role of CTO at [@Lykon](https://lykon.de/). Here I had the opportunity to guide a tech department on all fronts. With the experience I got from past challenges, I could share and help people to grow in their careers and build incredible products and technology in the coming years. It is a hard road, but it's one that I enjoy a lot.

Finally, I took a new challenge in FitTech as VP of Platform Engineering [@urbansportsclub](https://urbansportsclub.com). Here I need to help a scale-up organization become a mature, solid organization developing a strong product in a competitive market using [top-notch technology](https://tech-radar.urbansportsclub.tech) and fostering a healthy engineering culture.

Throughout my career, I worked with inspiring people on many challenging projects, solving interesting problems. Here I share my learnings for building and shipping successful products/projects from an engineer and leadership perspective.
