These last two weeks were an interesting one for me, full of new challenges and discoveries. I'm a person who likes data quite a lot. For me, a data-driven organization can be a much more successful one. Recently, I've learned about the [Four Keys](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance) project, which will help us measure our maturity when it comes to throughput and incident resolution. These metrics are the key for a high performing team, and that's where I want to take us.

Also, this week I want to start something I wanted to do a while ago. I want to start sharing the articles and books I like and learned from in my career. Many people ask me about which books I read, and if I have any materials to share. So, every 2 weeks I want to release interesting articles and books I have read and learned from.

I'm subscribed in a newsletter from a friend called [Paulo André](https://twitter.com/prla) called [The Weekly Hagakure](https://hagakure.substack.com/). It's a wonderful newsletter for leaders in tech. I do recommend that you subscribe there. What I also liked is the simple format of `3 articles`, `2 podcasts` and `1 book`. I will try to follow the same principle, but I'll start simple `3 articles` and `1 book`.

Let’s dive into this week’s picks. ✍️

## 3 Articles

✍️[Advice to Myself When Starting Out as a Software Developer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/advice-to-myself-when-starting-as-a-software-developer/)

> As I look back to over a decade ago, there are a few things I wish I'd started doing sooner. Habits that could have helped made me grow faster and in a more focused way. This is the advice I'd give my younger self, who has just landed their first professional software engineering job.

✍️[Collaborative Single Player Mode](https://blog.rstankov.com/collaborative-single-player-mode/)

> The core of the idea is simple - everyone should be able to execute without depending on other people. Especially in a remote environment, when people work at different times, this is essential.

✍️[How I Manage Impostor Syndrome, Fear of Failure, and Other Common Programmer Problems](https://dev.to/vtrpldn/how-i-manage-impostor-syndrome-fear-of-failure-and-other-common-programmer-problems-3nk6)

> Sometimes your own bugs are much harder to fix.
One thing that I noticed after all those years in the industry is that mastering the tech is only half of the battle. You know, being fluent in JavaScript isn't worth much if you are paralyzed by fear of failure and never step out of your programming cave.

## 1 Book

📚[The Phoenix Project](https://amzn.to/3kyPsVU)

I really love this book. It tells a great story about how concepts like Lean, Agile and DevOps can help you build a more effective and organized business. I really recommend every engineer, product, designer, or anybody working in Tech to read this book.

> After hearing from Grant Fritchey that "Anyone who wants to know what DevOps really means should read this" Claire Brooking picked up a copy of The Phoenix Project. This parable of an IT project on the brink of destruction is told with humor and insight. Claire reviews the book, finding that conflict, incidents and mistakes are inevitable - what counts is how the team members grow to manage and resolve them.
