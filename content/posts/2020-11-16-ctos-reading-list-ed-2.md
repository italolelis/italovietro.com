  I will soon share some metrics for Lykon on how this project is helping us
  become a more efficient tech department. Maybe I can also open source it in

I was finally able to build the [fourkeys](/posts/cto-reading-list-1) project I mentioned in my last article. I will soon share some metrics for Lykon on how this project is helping us become a more efficient tech department. Maybe I can also open source it in case someone would be interested in checking it out.

This week I've also been looking into Rust more in depth. Trying to understand how it works, it's ecosystem, and how it performs when compared to Go. I don't intend to change Go for Rust, but I'd like to understand it better and maybe, in the future, use it for something.

Let’s dive into this week’s picks. ✍️

## 3 Articles

✍️[Autoscaling Monzo: How we optimize our platform to be just the right size](https://monzo.com/blog/2020/10/19/autoscaling-monzo)
> An amazing review of how Monzo does autoscaling in their Kubernetes infrastructure. Monzo is one the references I always like to look when dealing complex Kubernetes set ups. Definitely worth a reading.

✍️[2020 State of DevOps Report](https://puppet.com/resources/report/2020-state-of-devops-report/)
> This week we had the state of devops report from puppet release. It's an interesting research, and I think it's worth reading it. It shows how the industry is evolving on understanding the devops culture.

✍️[On being a Senior Engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
> I always like to talk about, what does being a Senior Engineer actually is about? This article here summarizes a lot of things that I agree on, and I think every Sr. Engineer should strive to have. And what I also like about this post is the terminology of a mature Engineer. That's a great way of determine wether someone (being a senior engineer or not) has the emotional inteligence to deal with certain topics.

## 1 Book

📚[Grokking Algorithms](https://amzn.to/2IFpL91)

> Ah, the beauty of algorithms. This week I started re-reading this amazing piece of art. Doesn't matter if you are an experienced developer, or just started studying Computer Science, or a curious person. This books is for everyone. You'll have the opportunity to learn about the Big O notation, and how to properly use it. You'll dive into the mysteries of graphs, and trees.
The book is very didactic and easy to follow. Go ahead and read it, you'll love it!
